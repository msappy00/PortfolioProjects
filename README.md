# PortfolioProjects
A set of projects to showcase what I'm learning in the field of data analysis.
The end in mind is to contribute to an opensource project or find employment as a data analyst.

1) COVID Data Exploration (SQL Data Exploration)

This first of these projects is built from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects
and a Youtube course taught by Alex at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f

My code differs from the original because I'm using diffent software:
  LibreOffice Calc (spreadsheet program)
  DBeaver Universal Database Manager

The COVID dataset was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
