# PortfolioProjects
A set of projects to showcase what I'm learning in the field of data analysis.
The end in mind is to contribute to an opensource project or find employment as a data analyst.

1) Covid Dashboard

The Covid Dashboard was built from https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects
and a YouTube series taught by Alex The Analyst at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f

A 'live' version of my dashboard is up at https://msappy00.pythonanywhere.com/

My code differs from the original in the following ways:
* I used DBeaver Universal Database Manager instead of Microsoft SQL Server
* The dataset I used was taken about a year after the original project
* I used Plotly Dash instead of Tableau for the data visualizations

The COVID dataset was taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

2) Nashville Housing Data

The dataset here was cleaned up using standard SQL methods.

3) Movie Data Correlation

The dataset was scraped from IMDb and analyzed using Python with a focus on data correlation.
